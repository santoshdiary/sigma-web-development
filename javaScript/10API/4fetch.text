Fetch API is a modern JavaScript way to request data from a server (API) and receive a response.

👉 It is mainly used to:
Get data from a server (GET)
Send data to a server (POST)
Update or delete data (PUT / DELETE)


The Fetch API is a modern interface in JavaScript that allows you to make HTTP requests.
It replaces the older XMLHttpRequest method and provides a cleaner and more flexible way to
fetch resources asynchronously.
The Fetch API uses Promises, making it easier to work with asynchronous data.

-->> The fetch() function returns a Promise which is fulfilled with a Response 
object representing the server's response.

--> The fetch() function will reject the promise on some errors, but not if the server responds 
with an error status like 404: so we also check the response status and throw if 
it is not OK
