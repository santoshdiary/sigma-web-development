strict mode vs non strict mode after ES5 
//'use strict'
global Object: in window it is called "window", but in node js, It is called "global" 
'globalThis' points to global object of the environment 
// this keyword in global scope :Node js (empty object {}), in browser it will point to global object(Window)

// normal function :without strict mode, this will point to "global object", in strict mode will point to "undefine"
//**** call,apply, bind ,this points to the invoking object  *****

const user={
    name:'rohit',
    age:30,
    greet: function(){
        console.log(this) //Note: this==user   (current context )
        console.log(`Hi ${this.name}`) // means user.name 
    }
}
user.greet(); // greet invoke user object
