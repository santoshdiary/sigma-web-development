<!--The HTML DOM (Document Object Model) is a structured representation of a web page that allows developers to access, modify, and control its content and structure using JavaScript. It powers most dynamic website interactions, enabling features like real-time updates, form validation, and interactive user interfaces.

Why is DOM Required?
The DOM is essential because:


Dynamic Content Updates: Without reloading the page, the DOM allows content updates (e.g., form validation, AJAX responses).

User Interaction: It makes your webpage interactive (e.g., responding to button clicks, form submissions).

Flexibility: Developers can add, modify, or remove elements and styles in real-time.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: It provides a standard way for scripts to interact with web documents, ensuring browser compatibility.
