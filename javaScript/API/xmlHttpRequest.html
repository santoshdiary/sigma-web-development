    <!--The XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is a built-in JavaScript API used to perform HTTP requests and exchange data between a web page and a server without requiring a full page reload. This technique is the foundation of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). 

XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.-->
