1. What is an API?

API = Application Programming Interface
It allows two software systems to communicate.

Example:
Your JavaScript code → sends request → API server → returns data (JSON).



✅ 2. What is an API Request?

An API request means you ask the server for data.

In JavaScript, this is done using:

(a) fetch() — modern and most commonly used
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))

(b) XMLHttpRequest (older method)

Rarely used now.




✅ 3. What is the V8 Engine?

V8 = Google’s JavaScript engine
It runs inside:

Google Chrome

Node.js


V8 Responsibilities:

Converts JavaScript → machine code

Executes the code very fast

Manages memory

Helps in asynchronous operations (with help from Web APIs)



✅ 4. Browser Environment vs JS Engine

JavaScript alone cannot do everything.
The browser provides extra features:

Provided by Browser (NOT by JS):

DOM

fetch()

Timers (setTimeout, setInterval)

Web APIs

JavaScript (V8) only executes code.

✅ 5. How API Requests Actually Work

When you write fetch():

JS (V8) calls browser’s Web API

Browser sends network request

API server responds

Browser gives data to JS through callback queue

Event loop pushes data back into JS

✅ 6. Event Loop

Event Loop helps manage:

API responses

Timers

Async tasks

It ensures non-blocking behaviour in JavaScript.

✅ 7. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

Most API data comes in JSON format.

Example:

{
  "name": "Santosh",
  "age": 21
}


In JS:

JSON.parse()
JSON.stringify()
